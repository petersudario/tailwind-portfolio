                <p class="text-[15px] text-justify">
                  It all started in 2013 when I started to mess the code from
                  the game called "Minecraft", giving birth to the passion that
                  I have on programming.
                </p>
                <p class="text-[15px] text-justify">
                  In 2020, I started to learn programming in the last years of
                  high school (they offered courses along with normal
                  education), took the "Computer Technician" certificate in 2022
                  and, in 2023, started to get a degree of "Bachelor in
                  Information Systems" on PUCPR University, Brazil.<br /><br />
                  At the start of 2024, I joined as Founding President from the
                  Information Systems Academic Center at PUCPR, to provide
                  assistance to students and teachers, and to promote events
                  around the campus. Near the start of the second semester of
                  2024, I also joined as the 2nd Secretary of Central Student
                  Directory in PUCPR, providing assistance to all students from
                  the Curitiba Campus and other campuses around the state (like
                  Londrina and Toledo cities). And finally, nearing the end of
                  2024, I joined as the General Secretary from PUCPR Academic
                  Athletic Association of Computing (A.A.A.C - OCTACORE),
                  providing further assistance to the association's board and
                  members. All of these 3 entities includes a lot of work with
                  the student body, teachers and the university itself, to
                  provide a better experience for everyone involved, creating
                  events, encourage students to participate in academic events
                  and spread knowledge from their courses, and to provide
                  assistance to students that are in need of help on their
                  careers or studies.
                </p>
                <p class="text-[15px] text-justify">
                  Now moving out of the academic path: In 2023, I started to
                  work at Inuar Technology as a PHP Intern Developer, creating
                  modules, migrating databases and maintaining projects with
                  Symfony based frameworks.
                </p>

                <p class="text-[15px] text-justify">
                  On mid 2023, I left Inuar Technology and started to work on a
                  french multinational company called "Sagemcom", as a Intern
                  Research & Development Support Analyst, creating validation
                  tests for the company's products.
                </p>
                <p class="text-[15px] text-justify">
                  Jumping to August 2024, I left the Developer's team and moved
                  to the QA Team in Sagemcom, to provide support as a QA
                  Analyst, creating test cases, test plans, validate products,
                  analyze bugs and provide support to company's customers.
                  Despite the change, I kept evolving the validation libraries
                  and the test cases that I created in the Developer's team, as
                  a part-time QA Engineer.
                </p>

                <p class="text-[15px] text-justify">
                  Even with all of these events happening, I still have time to
                  work on personal projects and freelance jobs with friends and
                  contacts, to keep my skills sharp and to learn new
                  technologies and methods that I can use in my daily work.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I love reading classic horror
                  <i><b>such as Edgar Allan Poe and H.P Lovecraft</b></i> ,
                  manga comics, Sci-fi like
                  <i
                    ><b
                      >"Bladerunner - Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheeps?"</b
                    ></i
                  >
                  and mythlogy books like
                  <i><b>"Norse Mythology from Neil Gaiman".</b></i>
                </p>

                <p>
                  I also love movies, like
                  <b
                    ><i
                      >Alien, Guardians of the Galaxy, Star Wars, Oppenheimer,
                      Interstellar, Dune</i
                    ></b
                  >
                  and superhero movies.
                </p>

                <p>
                  And as a hobby, I love playing games and to listen to music.
